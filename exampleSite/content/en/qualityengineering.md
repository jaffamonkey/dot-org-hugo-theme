> Test development in line with development cycle.
- Every test should be able to provide the same answer of "Yes", at any point, to the question "Are you useful?".
- Starting lean with test framework is logical, wait for test developmemnt to highlight possible requirement.
- Native tools always preferred, firstly for synergy with development and secondly performance and scope larger.
- Test frameworks should be part of app codebase.
