# Phases of SDLC and Accessibility

To effectively integrate accessibility into the SDLC, it is essential to consider it at every phase of development.

## Planning
* Accessibility Requirements: Define accessibility goals and requirements at the outset. This includes understanding legal obligations and setting clear objectives for compliance with standards like WCAG.
* Stakeholder Involvement: Engage stakeholders, including users with disabilities, to gather insights and requirements.

## Analysis
* User Research: Conduct research to understand the needs of users with disabilities. This involves creating personas and user stories that reflect their requirements.
* Accessibility Audit: Assess existing systems and content for accessibility issues to identify areas needing improvement.

## Design
* Inclusive Design Principles: Apply inclusive design principles to create wireframes and prototypes. Ensure that design elements such as color contrast, font sizes, and navigation structures are accessible.
* Interactive Elements: Design forms, buttons, and other interactive elements to be easily usable by all users, including those relying on assistive technologies.

## Development
* Semantic HTML: Use semantic HTML to ensure that content is structured in a way that is easily interpretable by screen readers and other assistive technologies.
* ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications): Implement ARIA roles and attributes to enhance the accessibility of dynamic content.
* Keyboard Accessibility: Ensure that all functionality is accessible via keyboard, providing logical tab order and focus indicators.

## Testing
* Automated Testing Tools: Utilize automated tools like Axe, WAVE, and Lighthouse to identify accessibility issues early in the development process.
* Manual Testing: Conduct manual testing with assistive technologies such as screen readers (e.g., JAWS, NVDA) and voice recognition software.
* User Testing: Involve users with disabilities in usability testing to identify practical issues and gather feedback.

## Deployment
* Accessibility Statement: Provide an accessibility statement that outlines the accessibility features of the product and offers contact information for reporting issues.
* Continuous Monitoring: Monitor accessibility post-deployment to ensure ongoing compliance and address new issues as they arise.

## Maintenance
* Regular Audits: Perform regular accessibility audits to ensure that updates and new features continue to meet accessibility standards.
* User Feedback: Encourage feedback from users with disabilities to continuously improve accessibility.

## Tools and Resources
* WCAG: The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines provide comprehensive standards for web accessibility.
* Accessibility Testing Tools: Tools such as Axe, WAVE, and Lighthouse help automate the detection of accessibility issues.
* Development Frameworks: Use frameworks and libraries that support accessibility, such as React with accessible components or Bootstrap with built-in ARIA support.
