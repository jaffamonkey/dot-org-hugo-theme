# Quality engineering in the pipeline

How I can help ... Quality assurance to bring quality to all aspects of a project. Test engineering to build test frameworks for functional and non-functional testing within your CI/CD pipelines. Accessibility audits for your mobile or web apps.

25 years providing quality services on well over 100 projects, for 60+ clients. I can bring a wealth of technical skills expertise, along with delivering quality improvements to project pipeline - even on projects considered unrescuable.
