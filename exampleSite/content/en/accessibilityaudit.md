> Get an audit at any point in your project, and also get advice with pushing accessibility as part of your way of working, from design to code to production

_The audit targets a wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities._

Professionally evaluating the website's accessibility level is a key step in web accessibility and can be performed at any stage of a web or mobile app project.

## What you will get

- A full accessibility review and test of web or mobile app against the WCAG 2.2 AA standard.
- Delivery of a full, prioritised accessibility report of web and/or mobile app
- Weâ€™ll test with assistive technologies to aid the results
- An accessibility statement (inline with your current accessibility status) that can be published to a website advising on status of WCAG 2.2 AA compliance.
- Automated accessibility test framework for your CI pipeline

> Treat an audit as a startpoint, to integrating accessibility checks earlier in the development lifecycle.
