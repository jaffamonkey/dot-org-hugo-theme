## Accessibility audit
The audit targets a wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities.

> Auditing reporting available for web and mobile apps (WCAG 2.2).

## What you will get

- A full accessibility review and test of web or mobile app against the WCAG 2.2 AA standard (alongside UAAG 2.0)
- Delivery of a full, prioritised accessibility report of web or mobile app
- Weâ€™ll test with assistive technologies to aid the results
- An accessibility statement (inline with your current accessibility status) that can be published to a website advising on status of WCAG 2.2 AA compliance.
- Add accessibility tests in your CI pipeline

A first important step is to realise Acessibility is a continual improvements exercise.

Just because your app passes in Sprint 5, it doesn't mean it will pass in Sprint 8.

Treat an audit as a startpoint, to integrating accessibility checks earlier in the development lifecycle.
