Autism is a spectrum. Not everyone who is autistic prefers the same things.

Many autistic people also have associated other conditions, like Dyslexia or Learning Difficulties thatimpact on their preferences. Many do not have other conditions.

Other demographic factors can also impact people’s references, such as socio economic factors, and familiarity with technology.

These differences can make it challenging to design for all autistic web users.

> Background images 
* Background images have to have a purpose. Geometric shapes in muted colours
worked well but image collages were considered distracting.
* For autistic web users everything is equally important and they struggled
to distinguish between foreground and background.

> Logical sizing of elements
* Generally, participants associated the size of design elements (e.g. boxes)
with the importance of information/content presented in those areas.
* “The smaller box and the bigger box – it makes a hierarchy.”
* “Is the information in larger boxes more important?”

> No auto-playing content/movement
* Moving adverts in banners and pop-ups, auto-playing videos make websites inaccessible to most autistic web users.

{{< card >}}
> No surprises
* Generally, participants expressed (in one way or another) their dislike of unpredictable
situations and changes. This includes changing designs of websites that they used.
* Preview should be available with information on what pages, sections and videos are about before reading/watching them.
