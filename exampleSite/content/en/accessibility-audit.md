Accessibility audit
The audit targets a wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities.

Auditing reporting available for web and mobile apps (WCAG 2.2).

What you will get
A full accessibility review and test of web or mobile app against the WCAG 2.2 AA standard (alongside UAAG 2.0)
Delivery of a full, prioritised accessibility report of web or mobile app, which would indicate any elements of HealthWave Hub that are non-compliant and needed to be fixed to achieve WCAG 2.2 AA compliance, the order in which it is recommended non-compliant areas are fixed and details of how each non-compliant area could be fixed. Please note we won’t fix things for you but our outputs will tell you what needs to be done!
Either 1 x retest following implementation of fixes and a report updating you on WCAG 2.2 AA status
Asssistance with training you in automating WCAG 2.2 AA retests for accessibility which can give you continuous reporting per release.
We’ll test with assistive technologies to aid the results
We’ll test with users that have disabilities to give you a rounded view on your Web App’s Accessibility status
An accessibility statement (inline with your current accessibility status) that can be published to a website advising on status of WCAG 2.2 AA compliance.
Add accessibility tests in your CI pipeline
A first important step is to realise Acessibility is a continual improvements exercise.

Just because your app passes in Sprint 5, it doesn't mean it will pass in Sprint 8.

Treat an audit as a startpoint, to integrating accessibility checks earlier in the development lifecycle.
